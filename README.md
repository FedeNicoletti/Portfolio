# Portfolio

In this project, I learned the following:

ThreeJS, a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating 3D models.
React Three Fiber, a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React.
TailwindCSS, a popular utility-first CSS styling framework.
Framer Motion, the most popular library used to bring React websites to life with animations.
I also learned how to:
Load, create, and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and the positioning of an object in space.
Make my code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices.
Implement sending emails through a form on the website.
Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve site performance using Suspense and Preload.

I'm excited to demonstrate my skills in 3D graphics, React development, and industry-standard best practices in my project. Thank you for taking the time to review my project and I look forward to discussing it further with you.
