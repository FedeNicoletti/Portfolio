- I gained knowledge about ThreeJS, a powerful 3D graphics library used for rendering and animating 3D models.
- I learned about React Three Fiber, a popular library used to create 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React.
- I now have experience working with TailwindCSS, a widely used utility-first CSS styling framework.
- I became proficient in using Framer Motion, the most popular library for animating React websites and making them more engaging for users.
- I also learned how to load, create, and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lighting, as well as how to understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning objects in space.
- I discovered how to make my code more reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices.
- I learned how to implement email sending through a form on a website.
- I discovered how to ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve site performance using Suspense and Preload techniques.

I'm excited to demonstrate my skills in 3D graphics, React development, and industry-standard best practices in my project. Thank you for taking the time to review my project and I look forward to discussing it further with you.
